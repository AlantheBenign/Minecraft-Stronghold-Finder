# Minecraft Stronghold Finder
That's a code in Python that helps speedrunners to find the Stronghold the fastest way.

## What is it about?
This code uses Minecraft in-game information and, with geometry, calculates the best location to throw the ender eyes to (always) find the stronghold position. We could, theoretically, find the stronghold position using only two ender eyes, but this method requires the player to go to such locations that, to be precise and spend less time, it would need to know the stronghold location itself to find a good spot to throw the second ender eye (or go to far away, spending even more time), what is in itself a kind of a paradox. So, this program requires three ender eye throws to find the exactly the stronghold location.

## How to use it?
It's very simple to use! The player needs to, in any location (assuming that the player is looking for a stronghold in the first stronghold generation ring, which is true in a "good" speedrun), to throw the first ender eye, to look at it, looking exactly at the ender eye will grant the precision the player needs, and press F3+C ( ### WARNING:)
